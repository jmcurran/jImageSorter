# jImageSorter
A programme for rapid sorting of images into directories. 

This programme makes it easy to sort a large number of images into different directories/folders. I wrote it to help make it easier to build training sets for Tensorflow image classification. 

Of course it won't save you a tonne of time, but it's better than dragging and dropping several thousand images.

**Note** It isn't finished yet! :-)
